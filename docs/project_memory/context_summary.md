# Context Summary

**Last updated:** 2026-07-05

## Current Build State

Phases 0–2 merged to main. Phases 3 (subscriptions), 4 (mobile shells), early Phase 5 tasks,
Phase 8 (Recommendation Engine V1), Phase 9 (Routines/Meals/Commute/Sleep-Wake), Phase 10
(Notifications, Widgets, Ambient Surfaces), Phase 11 (Insights and Learning Summary), and Phase 12
(Admin Dashboard) complete. Phase 13 (Integrations Expansion) in progress — TIME-049 (Slack) done,
TIME-050 (Teams) next.

Backend API endpoints implemented:
- `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- `GET/PATCH /api/v1/users/me`, profiles, preferences
- Onboarding state machine, personality, consent records
- Admin routes
- `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/tasks` (soft-delete)
- `POST /api/v1/capture` (LLM parse → Task)
- Notifications, replan requests
- `GET /api/v1/now`, `GET /api/v1/today`
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations` (best + up to 2 alternatives + LLM "why" + usable_minutes + skipped_meals)
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/feedback` (done/snooze/not_now — suppresses task from future recommendations)
- `GET /api/v1/routines`, `PATCH /api/v1/routines/{routine_type}` (sleep/meal/hygiene blocks, default-seeded)
- `POST /api/v1/meals`, `GET /api/v1/meals/today` (skip inference via routine windows)
- `POST /api/v1/commute/detect` (location-consent gated), `GET /api/v1/commute/pending`,
  `POST /api/v1/commute/{id}/confirm`/`.../reject`
- `POST /api/v1/sleep/events` (health-data-consent gated, late wake proposes a morning replan),
  `GET /api/v1/sleep/today`
- `GET /api/v1/insights/weekly` (Premium-gated, generates+caches the most recently completed
  week's aggregate + LLM summary), `GET /api/v1/insights/history?limit=8`
- `GET /api/v1/admin/users?search=` (extended with search + real total), `GET /api/v1/admin/`
  `subscriptions`/`feedback`/`integrations`/`metrics`/`waitlist` (all new, admin-gated) — built for
  TIME-048's web admin dashboard alongside the already-existing `GET/POST /api/v1/invites/codes`
- `POST /api/v1/slack/connect` (Premium), `DELETE /api/v1/slack/disconnect`, `POST /api/v1/slack/`
  `scan` (Premium — reads messages, LLM-detects action items, creates *pending* suggestions only),
  `GET /api/v1/slack/pending`, `POST /api/v1/slack/actions/{id}/confirm` (approval gate — creates a
  Task, source=slack), `.../reject` (TIME-049)
- No new endpoints for TIME-043 — `notification_mode` (gentle/balanced/active_coach) already had
  read/write via `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/preferences`; TIME-043 only added the behavior that acts
  on it (NotificationService.maybe_send_morning_checkin/evening_checkout/learning_prompt), driven
  by a Celery beat schedule rather than a user-facing route

Database tables: users, profiles, preferences, personalities, onboarding_states, consent_records,
subscription_records, replan_requests, notifications, notification_events, tasks,
internal_reminders, recommendation_feedback, routine_assumptions, meal_events, commute_events,
sleep_wake_events, weekly_insights, calendar_integrations, pending_calendar_actions,
slack_integrations, slack_action_items. (Correction: there is no separate "notification_preferences"
table — the notification_mode field lives directly on user_preferences; a prior version of this
file listed that table incorrectly.)

Backend tests: 240, all passing (see Known Problems re: 2 flaky Stripe-network tests).

Mobile app shells:
- iOS SwiftUI: bottom tab navigator (Now/Today/Capture/Insights/Settings), AuthService with `#if canImport(FirebaseAuth)` stubs, CaptureViewModel + CaptureView wired to backend. `xcodebuild → BUILD SUCCEEDED`. Plus (TIME-044) a `TimeSenseWidgetExtension` WidgetKit target with three home-screen widgets (Usable Time, Next Up, Do Next) reading a shared App-Group snapshot the app writes. Insights tab (TIME-046) now shows a real weekly summary + stats grid behind the Premium gate.
- Android Kotlin/Compose: bottom nav, AuthViewModel, CaptureViewModel + CaptureScreen wired to backend. `./gradlew assembleDebug → BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Plus (TIME-045) two Jetpack Glance AppWidgets (Usable Time, Next Event), each reading its own Preferences state written by NowViewModel/TodayViewModel. Insights tab (TIME-046) mirrors iOS's real content.
- Both platforms (TIME-047): Settings > Preferences has a "Learned Assumptions" screen to view/edit the 6 RoutineAssumption blocks via the existing GET/PATCH /api/v1/routines endpoints — no backend changes.

Web companion (TIME-048, new): Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + Firebase Auth
(env-var-driven, no real project yet). Role-protected `/admin` dashboard: metrics/integration
status, user search, invite codes, subscriptions, feedback review. `npm run build`/`npm run lint`
both clean.

## Last Completed Work
TIME-049 (Jira TIME-48): Slack Integration
- `MessageSourceProvider` abstraction (read-only chat source, for Slack now + Teams later) +
  `SlackMessageSource` reading Slack's conversations.history API
- `slack_integrations` (token storage) + `slack_action_items` (approval queue) tables; SlackService
  with connect/disconnect/scan/confirm/reject
- The approval gate is the whole point: `scan_channel()` reads messages, LLM-detects action items,
  and creates *pending* SlackActionItem rows — NEVER Tasks. `confirm()` is the single path that
  creates a Task (source="slack", links created_task_id). Mirrors the calendar request→approve
  pattern exactly, satisfying "never auto-create from external signals without approval"
- `SlackDetectionService` split out for isolated LLM unit testing; degrades to "not an action item"
  on any LLM failure (same fallback discipline as CaptureService)
- No real Slack app (empty placeholder creds) — mobile client posts the OAuth token to
  /slack/connect like /calendar/connect; no server-side OAuth callback / Events API in this ticket
- Followed the repo's flat integration-file convention (message_source_base.py / slack_source.py),
  not the skill's idealized `slack/` subdir
- 14 new tests; full suite 240/240 (excluding 2 known-flaky Stripe tests). Single alembic head,
  both tables compile offline

Full history of TIME-034 through TIME-048 is in `implementation_log.md` and `change_summary.md`.

## Current Active Task
Phase 13 (Integrations Expansion) is in progress. Next up: TIME-050 (Microsoft Teams Integration) —
should reuse the `MessageSourceProvider` abstraction TIME-049 just added, adding a `TeamsMessageSource`
+ the same detect/confirm approval flow (likely a shared or parallel action-item queue). Also see
known_issues.md — the deferred UsableTimeService timezone-awareness pass (to actually subtract
routine/meal/commute/sleep blocks from usable time, and to make Celery beat/notification timing
per-user-local instead of UTC-only) is unblocked and still worth scheduling soon rather than
continuing to defer it across more tickets.

## iOS HealthKit Decision Point (deferred from TIME-042, still open)
TIME-042 only built the backend contract (ingest a wake_time signal, gate on health_data consent,
trigger a morning replan suggestion). The actual iOS-side HealthKit read integration
(`ios/.../HealthService.swift`, `HKHealthStore` authorization request, Info.plist usage-description
strings, calling `POST /api/v1/sleep/events` after reading sleep analysis samples) was not built in
TIME-044 either — it needs a real device with HealthKit entitlements/authorization UI, which is a
different kind of iOS work than TIME-044's WidgetKit target (no HealthKit involved there). Still
worth a deliberate decision (own ticket vs. folding into a later iOS tranche) — flag to the user
before scoping that work.

## Important Decisions to Preserve
- Firebase added via Xcode UI (File > Add Package Dependencies), NOT in pbxproj — `#if canImport` guards ensure CLI builds work
- `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist` are placeholders — need real Firebase Console files
- Native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) + native Android (Kotlin/Compose); web is companion only
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Firebase Auth + Redis/Celery + LLM abstraction
- Bottom tabs: Now, Today, Capture, Insights, Settings
- Calendar writes require approval; Replans require approval
- 14-day trial requires payment info; Free Basic Mode after trial expiry
- `not_now` feedback suppresses a task from recommendations for 4h, not permanently (TIME-038)
- Routine/meal blocks are UTC-minute-of-day only — not yet subtracted from usable time, deferred
  until UsableTimeService gains real timezone awareness (see Known Problems)
- User has authorized merging PRs without waiting for review during this autonomous run
  (2026-07-04) — re-confirm at the start of a new session rather than assuming it still stands

## Known Problems
- `python-dotenv` cannot parse multi-line `.env` values → non-blocking (warnings only)
- Firebase SPM cannot be resolved via CLI — needs Xcode UI
- No Docker/Postgres available in this session's environment — `alembic upgrade head` only
  verified offline (`--sql` mode); needs a real-DB check before deploy
- `phase_status.md`'s acceptance-criteria checkboxes for Phases 3–7 predate this file's tracking
  and need a reconciliation pass (see phase_status.md Staleness Warning)
- `UsableTimeService` is UTC-only and doesn't yet subtract routine/meal blocks — full details in
  known_issues.md
- `test_referrals.py::test_conversion_extends_subscriptions` / `test_no_double_conversion` fail on
  real Stripe network calls in this sandbox (intermittent at first, now consistent this session) —
  reproduces identically on `main`, unrelated to any code change (known_issues.md)
- No calendar-event-location correlation for commute detection (TIME-041) — no CalendarEvent table
  with location data exists in this codebase yet

## Warnings for Next Session
- Read this file + phase_status.md before doing anything.
- The `.env` file is gitignored and contains real secrets — never commit it.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.devcontainer/` are untracked leftovers from a prior session
  (an already-documented devcontainer firewall fix that was never committed) — not part of any
  ticket in this session, left alone; flag to the user if they want that committed separately.
