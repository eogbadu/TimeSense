# Context Summary

**Last updated:** 2026-07-06

## v1 STATUS: FEATURE-COMPLETE (2026-07-06)

The v1 build is closed out (TIME-058 / Jira TIME-86). The full loop works end-to-end on device:
sign in → capture → auto-scheduled into the day → Now recommends the best next action with a
justified "Why this?" + alternatives → complete → the assistant learns your durations. The
scheduling **"brain"** is done: duration estimation (seed lookup table + per-user learned overrides,
TIME-082/083), auto-placement with Undo (TIME-085), feasibility warnings (TIME-084), configurable
working hours (TIME-086), all grounded in local time (TIME-080/081). Premium UI pass done (TIME-073);
Settings fully functional incl. Sign Out + Delete (TIME-076). On-device dev reaches the Mac backend
over the LAN (TIME-087). Backend suite **329 passing**; iOS + web build clean (Android unverified —
no JDK locally). Smoke: `python scripts/smoke_test.py` all PASS. See docs/launch/release_checklist.md
+ beta_smoke_test.md.

**Next:** release-gating work (deploy backend behind HTTPS + point apps at the prod URL; store
assets/submission; human privacy-policy review; rotate the exposed Android API key) and the post-v1
feature backlog (per-weekday working hours, feasibility for all tasks, in-app calendar OAuth /
StoreKit purchase / data-export download). The user will file tickets for these after v1.

## Current Build State

Phases 0–2 merged to main. Phases 3 (subscriptions), 4 (mobile shells), early Phase 5 tasks,
Phase 8 (Recommendation Engine V1), Phase 9 (Routines/Meals/Commute/Sleep-Wake), Phase 10
(Notifications, Widgets, Ambient Surfaces), Phase 11 (Insights and Learning Summary), and Phase 12
(Admin Dashboard) complete. Phase 13 (Integrations Expansion) in progress — TIME-049 (Slack),
TIME-050 (Teams), TIME-051 (Notion), TIME-052 (Siri Shortcuts / App Intents) done; TIME-053 (Google
Assistant) next, plus a queued HealthKit ticket (deferred from TIME-042).

Backend API endpoints implemented:
- `GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- `GET/PATCH /api/v1/users/me`, profiles, preferences
- Onboarding state machine, personality, consent records
- Admin routes
- `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/tasks` (soft-delete)
- `POST /api/v1/capture` (LLM parse → Task)
- Notifications, replan requests
- `GET /api/v1/now`, `GET /api/v1/today`
- `GET /api/v1/recommendations` (best + up to 2 alternatives + LLM "why" + usable_minutes + skipped_meals)
- `POST /api/v1/recommendations/feedback` (done/snooze/not_now — suppresses task from future recommendations)
- `GET /api/v1/routines`, `PATCH /api/v1/routines/{routine_type}` (sleep/meal/hygiene blocks, default-seeded)
- `POST /api/v1/meals`, `GET /api/v1/meals/today` (skip inference via routine windows)
- `POST /api/v1/commute/detect` (location-consent gated), `GET /api/v1/commute/pending`,
  `POST /api/v1/commute/{id}/confirm`/`.../reject`
- `POST /api/v1/sleep/events` (health-data-consent gated, late wake proposes a morning replan),
  `GET /api/v1/sleep/today`
- `GET /api/v1/insights/weekly` (Premium-gated, generates+caches the most recently completed
  week's aggregate + LLM summary), `GET /api/v1/insights/history?limit=8`
- `GET /api/v1/admin/users?search=` (extended with search + real total), `GET /api/v1/admin/`
  `subscriptions`/`feedback`/`integrations`/`metrics`/`waitlist` (all new, admin-gated) — built for
  TIME-048's web admin dashboard alongside the already-existing `GET/POST /api/v1/invites/codes`
- `POST /api/v1/slack/connect` (Premium), `DELETE /api/v1/slack/disconnect`, `POST /api/v1/slack/`
  `scan` (Premium — reads messages, LLM-detects action items, creates *pending* suggestions only),
  `GET /api/v1/slack/pending`, `POST /api/v1/slack/actions/{id}/confirm` (approval gate — creates a
  Task, source=slack), `.../reject` (TIME-049)
- `POST /api/v1/teams/*` — same shape as slack (connect/disconnect/scan/pending/confirm/reject),
  reads MS Teams via Microsoft Graph, Task source=teams (TIME-050). Slack + Teams share one
  source-neutral `ActionItemDetectionService`
- `POST /api/v1/notion/*` (connect/disconnect/scan/pending + items/{id}/import|dismiss) — reads a
  Notion database's pages as candidate tasks (structured title/due extraction, NO LLM), user
  imports → Task source=notion (TIME-051). Uses a separate `TaskSourceProvider` abstraction, not
  the chat-oriented `MessageSourceProvider`
- `POST /api/v1/assistant/webhook` — Google Assistant / Dialogflow fulfillment (TIME-053);
  dispatches the same 5 actions as the iOS App Intents (what to do next / log lunch / start focus /
  mark done / replan day) to backend actions, returns spoken fulfillment text. Firebase-gated as the
  account-linked identity
- `GET /api/v1/admin/analytics` — admin event counts (TIME-054); analytics_events recorded by
  AnalyticsService gated on the `analytics` consent (emits task_captured from /capture)
- `GET /api/v1/privacy/export` (portable JSON of all the user's data, tokens redacted) +
  `DELETE /api/v1/privacy/account?confirm=true` (erase account + cascade all data + Firebase user) (TIME-055)
- No new endpoints for TIME-043 — `notification_mode` (gentle/balanced/active_coach) already had
  read/write via `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/preferences`; TIME-043 only added the behavior that acts
  on it (NotificationService.maybe_send_morning_checkin/evening_checkout/learning_prompt), driven
  by a Celery beat schedule rather than a user-facing route

Database tables: users, profiles, preferences, personalities, onboarding_states, consent_records,
subscription_records, replan_requests, notifications, notification_events, tasks,
internal_reminders, recommendation_feedback, routine_assumptions, meal_events, commute_events,
sleep_wake_events, weekly_insights, calendar_integrations, pending_calendar_actions,
slack_integrations, slack_action_items, teams_integrations, teams_action_items, notion_integrations,
notion_import_items, analytics_events. (Correction: there is no separate "notification_preferences" table — the
notification_mode field lives directly on user_preferences; a prior version of this file listed
that table incorrectly.)

Backend tests: 328, all passing (see Known Problems re: 2 flaky Stripe-network tests). The backend
verifies REAL Firebase ID tokens as of TIME-061 (real service account for project timesense-eb7ec
in .env; tests still mock verify_id_token and don't run the app lifespan). config.py loads the
repo-root .env from any CWD (TIME-064); /users/me syncs the DB role from the token claim (TIME-065).

**Full local stack verified working end-to-end this session:** web (localhost:3000, `cd web && npm
run dev`) → real Firebase email/password sign-in → backend (localhost:8000, `cd backend && uvicorn
app.main:app`, Homebrew Postgres 14 on :5432 with a `timesense` role+db created by hand) → admin
dashboard with live data. The web signs in with Email/Password (not Google — must be enabled in the
console). Admin = Firebase custom claim `role: admin` (now auto-mirrored to the DB via TIME-065).

Mobile app shells:
- iOS SwiftUI: bottom tab navigator (Now/Today/Capture/Insights/Settings), AuthService with `#if canImport(FirebaseAuth)` stubs, CaptureViewModel + CaptureView wired to backend. `xcodebuild → BUILD SUCCEEDED`. Plus (TIME-044) a `TimeSenseWidgetExtension` WidgetKit target with three home-screen widgets (Usable Time, Next Up, Do Next) reading a shared App-Group snapshot the app writes. Insights tab (TIME-046) now shows a real weekly summary + stats grid behind the Premium gate.
- Android Kotlin/Compose: bottom nav, AuthViewModel, CaptureViewModel + CaptureScreen wired to backend. `./gradlew assembleDebug → BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Plus (TIME-045) two Jetpack Glance AppWidgets (Usable Time, Next Event), each reading its own Preferences state written by NowViewModel/TodayViewModel. Insights tab (TIME-046) mirrors iOS's real content.
- Both platforms (TIME-047): Settings > Preferences has a "Learned Assumptions" screen to view/edit the 6 RoutineAssumption blocks via the existing GET/PATCH /api/v1/routines endpoints — no backend changes.
- iOS (TIME-052): 5 App Intents under `ios/TimeSense/Intents/` (what to do next, log lunch, start focus, mark done, replan day) + an AppShortcutsProvider exposing them to Siri/Shortcuts. **The iOS Simulator runtime is now installed** (iOS 18.0) — scheme builds + `simctl` runs work; use `xcodebuild -scheme TimeSense -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'` going forward (see known_issues.md, RESOLVED).

Web companion (TIME-048, new): Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + Firebase Auth
(env-var-driven, no real project yet). Role-protected `/admin` dashboard: metrics/integration
status, user search, invite codes, subscriptions, feedback review. `npm run build`/`npm run lint`
both clean.

## Last Completed Work
TIME-062 (Jira TIME-56): Client Firebase Config (iOS + Android)
- iOS: linked firebase-ios-sdk (pinned 11.x → 11.15.0; 12.x needs Swift tools 6.1 > this Xcode 16.0)
  + GoogleSignIn-iOS (8.x) to the TimeSense target via the xcodeproj gem; added
  GoogleService-Info.plist (project timesense-eb7ec, bundle com.aetheranalytics.timesense —
  gitignored, not committed). The real `#if canImport(FirebaseAuth)` AuthService now compiles (it
  imports GoogleSignIn for signInWithGoogle → had to add that package too)
- Android: replaced the placeholder google-services.json with the real timesense-eb7ec config
  (google-services plugin + firebase-auth deps already wired)
- Committed project.pbxproj + Package.resolved; .gitignore now ignores xcuserdata/ + .swiftpm/
- Verified: iOS Simulator BUILD SUCCEEDED; app launches with FirebaseApp.configure() on the real
  plist. Remaining: web/.env.local (user's apiKey/appId), console sign-in providers, device run

### (previous) TIME-053 (Jira TIME-55): Google Assistant Integration
- `backend/app/integrations/google_assistant.py` — Dialogflow fulfillment webhook exposing the same
  5 actions as the iOS App Intents (WhatToDoNext/StartFocus/LogLunch/MarkDone/ReplanDay); reuses the
  /now best-task logic (TaskRepository + UsableTimeService + TaskScorer), MealRepository,
  TaskRepository. POST /api/v1/assistant/webhook, Firebase-gated (account-linked stand-in)
- Backend-only per the ticket's stated file; ReplanDay opens the app (no headless replan). Honest
  limits: Actions-on-Google conversational actions were shut down June 2023, so this is the
  Dialogflow webhook contract + intent→action mapping (unit-tested), not a live Assistant round-trip;
  account-linking/OAuth out of scope. 10 new tests; suite 281/281 (excl. 2 flaky Stripe)

### (previous) TIME-061 (Jira TIME-54): Backend Real Firebase Token Verification
- `app/core/firebase.py` now robustly parses the real .env service account (project
  timesense-eb7ec), which is stored single-line with newlines flattened to literal `\n`: try
  compact `json.loads`, else `json.loads(raw.replace("\\n","\n"), strict=False)`. The Admin SDK now
  initializes (verified out-of-band: logs "initialized … for project: timesense-eb7ec") and
  `get_current_user` → `verify_id_token` now checks REAL client tokens
- 4 new unit tests (fabricated key, never the real one); full suite 271/271 (excl. 2 flaky Stripe)
- Client config still needed (NOT in .env): iOS GoogleService-Info.plist, Android
  google-services.json, web NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY/APP_ID/AUTH_DOMAIN — from the
  timesense-eb7ec console per registered app. Real key stays in .env, never committed.

### (previous) TIME-060 (Jira TIME-53): iOS HealthKit Sleep/Wake Read Integration
- `HealthService.swift` (HKHealthStore behind `#if canImport(HealthKit)`): requests sleepAnalysis
  read auth, reads the latest sleep window (allAsleepValues; earliest start + latest end = wake),
  POSTs {wake_time, sleep_start, source:"healthkit"} to /api/v1/sleep/events. Read-only. Publishes
  a HealthConnectState surfaced by a "Connect Apple Health" Settings row
- HealthKit entitlement + NSHealthShareUsageDescription added; completes the TIME-042 sleep/wake
  feature's mobile half — no backend changes
- Simulator build ✓; HealthKit really linked (verified in the Debug build's TimeSense.debug.dylib:
  HealthKit.framework load command + _OBJC_CLASS_$_HKHealthStore ref). App installs + launches
  cleanly under the new bundle id com.aetheranalytics.timesense. Live auth prompt + real sleep data
  + on-device run are the user's device step.

### (previous) TIME-059 (Jira TIME-52): iOS Real Apple Signing Configuration
- Wired the iOS project to the user's real Apple Developer account (Team WB5NV894N5, from .env):
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM on app + widget targets; bundle IDs renamed com.timesense.app →
  com.aetheranalytics.timesense (+ .TimeSenseWidget); App Group group.com.timesense.app →
  group.com.aetheranalytics.timesense across both entitlements + WidgetSnapshot.appGroupID
- Simulator build ✓. Signed 'generic/platform=iOS' build with the App Store Connect API key
  authenticated with Apple and reached provisioning — blocked ONLY on "no registered device" (the
  user plugs in their iPhone to finish). Config validated against the real account. Temp .p8 key
  was materialized in scratchpad (decoding the .env's literal-\n), used, and deleted — never
  committed. Android applicationId untouched (separate Google Play concern).

### (previous) TIME-052 (Jira TIME-51): Siri Shortcuts / App Intents
- 5 App Intents under `ios/TimeSense/Intents/` (WhatToDoNext, LogLunch, StartFocus, MarkDone,
  ReplanDay) + an AppShortcutsProvider exposing them to Siri and the Shortcuts app with
  \(.applicationName)-prefixed phrases
- Intents call APIClient.shared and reuse existing /now, /meals, /tasks endpoints + the
  NowContext/NowTask decodables — no new networking. ReplanDay opens the app (replans require
  in-app approval, never headless)
- **Verified against the now-available iOS Simulator** (user installed a runtime this session):
  scheme build → BUILD SUCCEEDED; booted iPhone 16 sim + install/launch → app runs to its sign-in
  screen without crashing; all 5 intents present in the app's Metadata.appintents bundle
- Not yet: Siri *voice* invocation (real device only) and backend round-trip (real Firebase still
  placeholder — the app sits at the auth gate)

Full history of TIME-034 through TIME-052 + net-new TIME-059/060/061 is in `implementation_log.md`
and `change_summary.md`.

## Current Active Task
No specific ticket in flight. Candidate next steps (ask the user): (a) client Firebase config so a
client can actually sign in end-to-end — iOS GoogleService-Info.plist + Firebase SPM, Android
google-services.json, web NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_* from the timesense-eb7ec console (the backend
already verifies real tokens as of TIME-061); (b) remaining Phase 13 items in
tickets/implementation_sequence.md (TIME-054+); (c) the deferred UsableTimeService timezone-awareness
pass (subtract routine/meal/commute/sleep from usable time + per-user-local Celery timing). Note the
impl-seq vs Jira offset changed once net-new tickets (TIME-059/060/061) were inserted — always
confirm the Jira key from the creation output, don't assume internal-minus-1. Two message-source
integrations (Slack, Teams) share `ActionItemDetectionService`; Notion stands alone on
`TaskSourceProvider`; a 3rd chat source is the trigger to unify Slack+Teams tables (decision_log.md).

## iOS device runs — remaining user steps (post TIME-059/060)
Real signing (Team WB5NV894N5, App ID com.aetheranalytics.timesense) and the HealthKit entitlement
are wired. For an actual on-device run the user: registers their iPhone's UDID (automatic when the
device is connected in their Xcode, or manually in the portal), then builds/runs from Xcode. The
live HealthKit authorization prompt + real sleep data are inherently device/Simulator-interactive
(not CLI-drivable). The BACKEND now verifies real Firebase tokens (TIME-061), but the CLIENT apps
still lack their Firebase config (iOS GoogleService-Info.plist, Android google-services.json, web
apiKey/appId/authDomain — from the timesense-eb7ec console; iOS also needs Firebase SPM resolved in
Xcode). So a client can't yet obtain a real token to send — client-side sign-in end-to-end is the
remaining gap.

## Important Decisions to Preserve
- Firebase iOS SDK (11.15.0) + GoogleSignIn are now IN the pbxproj as SPM packages (TIME-062), linked to the TimeSense target; the `#if canImport(FirebaseAuth)` guards still protect any toolchain that can't resolve them. Pinned to 11.x because 12.x needs Swift tools 6.1 > Xcode 16.0
- `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist` are placeholders — need real Firebase Console files
- Native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) + native Android (Kotlin/Compose); web is companion only
- FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Firebase Auth + Redis/Celery + LLM abstraction
- Bottom tabs: Now, Today, Capture, Insights, Settings
- Calendar writes require approval; Replans require approval
- 14-day trial requires payment info; Free Basic Mode after trial expiry
- `not_now` feedback suppresses a task from recommendations for 4h, not permanently (TIME-038)
- Routine/meal blocks are UTC-minute-of-day only — not yet subtracted from usable time, deferred
  until UsableTimeService gains real timezone awareness (see Known Problems)
- User has authorized merging PRs without waiting for review during this autonomous run
  (2026-07-04) — re-confirm at the start of a new session rather than assuming it still stands

## Known Problems
- `python-dotenv` cannot parse multi-line `.env` values → non-blocking (warnings only)
- Firebase SPM cannot be resolved via CLI — needs Xcode UI
- No Docker/Postgres available in this session's environment — `alembic upgrade head` only
  verified offline (`--sql` mode); needs a real-DB check before deploy
- `phase_status.md`'s acceptance-criteria checkboxes for Phases 3–7 predate this file's tracking
  and need a reconciliation pass (see phase_status.md Staleness Warning)
- `UsableTimeService` is UTC-only and doesn't yet subtract routine/meal blocks — full details in
  known_issues.md
- `test_referrals.py::test_conversion_extends_subscriptions` / `test_no_double_conversion` fail on
  real Stripe network calls in this sandbox (intermittent at first, now consistent this session) —
  reproduces identically on `main`, unrelated to any code change (known_issues.md)
- No calendar-event-location correlation for commute detection (TIME-041) — no CalendarEvent table

## Warnings for Next Session
- Read this file + phase_status.md before doing anything.
- The `.env` file is gitignored and contains real secrets — never commit it.
- `.claude/settings.local.json` and `.devcontainer/` are untracked leftovers from a prior session
  (an already-documented devcontainer firewall fix that was never committed) — not part of any
  ticket in this session, left alone; flag to the user if they want that committed separately.
